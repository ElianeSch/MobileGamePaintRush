The Choko font was created by Måns Grebäck in 2011 but remained unreleased until 2016. 

Place the different styles on top of each other to create a multicolor text. 
If you have Photoshop, you can use the PSD file attached to the download to write anything you like. 

This font can be used for any project, commercial or non-commercial, 100% for free.
